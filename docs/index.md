# Paperbush ðŸŒ¿

Paperbush is a dead easy argument parsing tool that simplifies the process of creating command-line argument parsers in Python. With Paperbush, you can define your parser in just a single line of code using a custom built-in language, which is then translated directly into the built-in `argparse` module equivalent. This means that in most cases, moving to Paperbush is just a matter of changing the parser definition, as `Paperbush.parse_args()` returns an `argparse.Namespace` object.
